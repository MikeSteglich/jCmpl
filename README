*********** jCMPL **********************************************
jCMPL is the CMPL API  for Java. 
The main idea of this API is 
* to define sets and parameters within the user application, 
* to start and control the solving process and 
* to read the solution(s) into the application if the problem is feasible. 
All variables, objective functions and constraints are defined in CMPL. 
These functionalities can be used with a local CMPL installation or a CMPLServer.

To use these functionalities in your own Java application you have to link your 
application agains jCMPL.jar and agains all of the jar files
in jCmpl/lib.

In addition, it is necessary to set an environment variable CMPLHOME, which contains CMPL's 
home directory.
